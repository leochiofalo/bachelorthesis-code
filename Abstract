While the gender wage gap has been extensively studied, wage dis- parities based on nationality remain relatively underexplored. This the- sis examines wage differences between Swiss and non-Swiss workers us- ing data from the Swiss Household Panel (SHP) spanning 1999 to 2021, considering variations by region of origin and the extent to which these gaps can be explained by factors such as education, age, and gender. The empirical analysis employs multivariate regression models to do so. Findings reveal significant wage gaps even after accounting for educa- tion, particularly for workers from non-European countries, suggesting potential discrimination or challenges in the transferability of foreign- acquired human capital. Wage disparities for European workers have narrowed over time.
